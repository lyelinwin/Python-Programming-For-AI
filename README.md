# Python Programming For AI
## Hello, welcome to my graduate portfolio.
----------
Back story: My original plan was go to med school, but when I started to learn how to code in connection with science, I realized that I want to enter the technology world and advance my skills.
Follow along in my journey in learning Python to program AI as the future advances.

During my 1st semesters at Texas A&M - Commerce for the MS in AI. I have learned the fundamentals of python and handling large data sets.


### Topics that I have learned: 
- Coding Environment
- Program Execution (Memory)
- Types: Basic (Variables) & Data Structures
- INT/FLOAT operations
- LIST/STR/DICT operators 
- input/output
- Decisions, if statements, loops
- list, list comprehensions, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- functions, abstraction, calling and defining functions
- Numpy : array, multi-dimensional arrays, array arithmetic, boolean indexing, matrix multiplication, aggregate functions
- Pandas : creating series, basic plots, slicing and counting in series, functions at series level, converting & saving series, creating dataframe & manipulating the columns to gather information, simlple and compound querry, visualization, web scraping, data cleaning
- plotly : types of visualization using express, installing geopy, creating html
- text classification
- types of evaluations : accuracy, errors, precision, recall, f1-score, confusion matrix
- scikit-learn : train_test_split, DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression, classification_report, cross validation,
- PyTorch (or Keras)
- HuggingFace


### Each assignment was a task for us to tackle and put what we learn in class with the real world.
- Assignment 2: Strings, If statements, loops, and files
- Assignment 3: Reading file, determininng the number of wins and storing the data
- Assignment 4: NumPy
- Assignment 5: Handling with missing data, providing visualizaion, using Pandas and Python to gather specific informations
- Midterm: Handling missing data and a short dataframe while using Pandas and Python codes to discover the answer
- Assignment 7: Using Plotly, Pandas, and Python to tackle each task
- Project: Applying what I have learned to topic related to AI, and reveal the findings
